      In the game between Hungary and France the audience witnessed a whopping 16 goals shared by the sides. The final shot and its class is only shown by the most talented players and there are no shortage of such in both of these teams. However player #9 managed to swing in a shot in the final seconds of the game, giving his team a well deserved win.
